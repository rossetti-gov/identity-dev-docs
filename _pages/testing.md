# Register your service provider

Once you have a working SP implementation, contact us at [partners@login.gov](mailto:partners@login.gov) to register your application. These are some of the attributes you'll need to be prepared to provide:

  The name for your SP that will be displayed to users.

- <span id="issuer" data-anchor>**Issuer** *required*</span>
  The SP entity ID, a unique string used to identify your SP with login.gov.
  Example:
  ```
  urn:gov:gsa:SAML:2.0.profiles:sp:sso:DEPT-AGENCY:APP-ENV
  ```

- <span id="agency" data-anchor>**Agency**\* *required*</span>

- <span id="public-certificate" data-anchor>**Public certificate** *required*</span>
  The public certificate, PEM encoded, allowing login.gov to verify the authenticity of authentication and logout requests. Learn how to [generate a self-signed certificate]({{site.baseurl}}/certs/).

## Additional Attributes

### SAML

These attributes are only needed for SAML implementations.

- <span id="acs-url" data-anchor>**Assertion consumer service URL** *required*</span>
  Your application endpoint which receives authentication assertions.
  Example:
  ```
  https://app.agency.gov/auth/saml/sso
  ```

- <span id="acl-url" data-anchor>**Assertion consumer logout service URL** *required*</span>
  The endpoint which receives logout requests and responses.
  Example:
  ```
  https://app.agency.gov/auth/saml/logout
  ```

- <span id="sp-initiated-login-url" data-anchor>**SP initiated login URL**\* *required*</span>
  The endpoint which initializes authentication with login.gov. This is used to trigger a new authentication request and response at the SP for better usability.
  Example:

  ```
  https://app.agency.gov/users/auth/saml/login
  ```

- <span id="return-to-sp-url" data-anchor>**Return to SP URL**\* *required*</span>
  The URL of the SP which login.gov provides to users when they wish to go directly to the SP site or cancel out of authentication.
  Example:
  ```
  https://app.agency.gov
  ```

- <span id="attribute-bundle" data-anchor>**Attribute bundle**\*</span>
  The preset bundle of attributes your SP requires. login.gov allows you to either pre-define what attributes your SP receives or request them at run time. [See the list of available attributes.]({{site.baseurl}}/attributes/)

### OpenID Connect

This is only needed for OpenID Connect clients.

- <span id="redirect-uri" data-anchor>**Redirect URI** *required*</span>
  The URI that login.gov should redirect to after authorization. This can be a custom scheme to support native applications.
  Example:
  ```
  x-example-app:/result
  ```
