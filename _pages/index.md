## Welcome to the login.gov developer guide

This contains everything you'll need as a federal government agency to integrate and deploy your application with [login.gov](https://login.gov).

### To get started...

<div markdown="1" class="checklist">
- First, build your application. We have guides for both [OpenID Connect]({{ site.baseurl }}/oidc) (recommended) and [SAML]({{ site.baseurl }}/saml). We also have example apps to get you up and running quickly.
- Next, use our dashboard to [register your app]({{ site.baseurl }}/testing).
- Create test accounts with our identity provider (IdP) and start testing.
